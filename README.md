## Lab Handouts and Code for POLSCI733 Probability and Regression (Spring 2018)

*Haohan Chen*

[Lab 1 Intro to R Markdown](../../tree/master/01-Intro-to-Rmarkdown): An introduction (or review for some of you) to Rmarkdown.

[Lab 5 Review of Likelihood](../../tree/master/05-Review-Likelihood): What is likelihood? What is maximum likelihood. Some maths and some simulation.

[Lab 6 Get confidence interval through simulation](../../tree/master/06-Simulateion-OLS-Logit-Probit): How to approximate distributions of estimated coefficients in Logit and Probit models with a simulation approach?

[Lab 7 Prediction in Logit and Probit Models](../../tree/master/07-Predict-Logit-Visualize): How to predict and get uncertainty of our prediction for Logit and Probit model? We use a simulation approach again. Don't count on build-in functions of the `glm` package. There's quite a lot of coding here.

[Lab 8 Multinomial Data](../../tree/master/08-Multinomial-Data): Appropriate models when outcomes are categorical. Simulation of confidence intervals of coefficients. Simulation of predictive intervals.

[Lab 10 Hierarchical Model](../../tree/master/10-Hierarchical-Model): Multi-level models. When to use random effect or fixed effect? Why? How about Bayesian approach? Demonstrated with new ANES data of attitudes about Trump.

[Lab 12 Panel Data](../../tree/master/12-Panel-Data): Time series. This tutorial just discuss some simpliest models in this family. It's basically an extension of hierarchical modeling discussed in the previous section.
